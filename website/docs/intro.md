# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics** — your comprehensive guide to embodied artificial intelligence and the development of intelligent humanoid robots.

## What is Physical AI?

**Physical AI** represents the convergence of artificial intelligence, robotics, and embodied cognition. Unlike traditional AI that operates in virtual environments, Physical AI systems must navigate, interact with, and learn from the physical world. This field combines:

- Machine learning for real-world adaptation
- Robotic control and locomotion
- Sensorimotor integration
- Embodied cognition principles
- Human-robot interaction

## The Rise of Humanoid Robotics

Humanoid robots represent one of the most ambitious goals in robotics research. These robots, designed with human-like form and capabilities, offer unique advantages:

1. **Environment Compatibility**: Designed to operate in human spaces
2. **Social Interaction**: More intuitive communication with humans
3. **Versatile Manipulation**: Human-like dexterity for complex tasks
4. **Cognitive Modeling**: Embodied platforms for understanding human intelligence

## Course Structure

This textbook is organized into four comprehensive modules:
